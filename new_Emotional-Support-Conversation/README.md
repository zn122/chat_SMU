## Data

The corpus file is `ESConv.json`. We have collected **more** conversations with more problem topics. ESConv now contians 1,300 conversations with 10 topic problems.

`sentiment_chatbot_dataset_csv` : Add an emotion tag for each text.

### Statistics
#### Problem Category

| Problem Category | ongoing depression | breakup with partner | job crisis | problems with friends | academic pressure | procras-<br>tination* | alcohol abuse* | issues with parent* | sleep problems* |  appearance anxiety* | school bullying* | issues with children* |

#### Emotion Category
anger, anxiety, depression, disgust, fear, guilt, jealousy, nervousness, pain, sadness, shame, neutral

\* denotes the new topics added during the second collection. We hope new data supports the future research in transferring the ability of models from old topics to new ones.

## Preparing Enviroment

```bash
conda env create -f env.yml -n cuda
conda activate cuda
```
or 

#### In CoLAB

`chatbot_train & run.ipynb` You must run the cells in the this ipynb file to set Python == 3.7, torch == 1.7.1, and transformers == 4.9.2.

## Model
You can check the model used in the `Blenderbot_small-90M` folder.

If you would like to evaluate generated results with Embedding-based similarity, you can download my prepared embedding files from [here](https://1drv.ms/f/s!Aky8v8NZbQx1qj7OlJKcQEJ6qrWm).

## Preprocessing &  Training 
`!python prepare.py`, `!python train.py in file` in `chatbot_train & run.ipynb` 

## Inference with Your Model
every 10,20,30,40,50 epochs of model training will create a new folder in `DATA/{inputter_name}.{config_name}`, which is named after the time when the training starts.
