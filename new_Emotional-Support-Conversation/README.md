## Data

The corpus file is `ESConv.json`. We have collected **more** conversations with more problem topics. ESConv now contians 1,300 conversations with 10 topic problems.

`sentiment_chatbot_dataset_csv` : Add an emotion tag for each text.

### Statistics
#### Problem Category

| Problem Category | ongoing depression | breakup with partner | job crisis | problems with friends | academic pressure | procras-<br>tination* | alcohol abuse* | issues with parent* | sleep problems* |  appearance anxiety* | school bullying* | issues with children* |
| :-------- | :---------- | :---------- |  :---------- |  :---------- |  :---------- |  :---------- |  :---------- |  :---------- |  :---------- |  :---------- | :---------- | :---------- | 
| Number| 351 | 239 | 280 | 179 | 156 |  13 | 12 | 18 | 28 | 12 | 2 | 10 |

#### Emotion Category
anger, anxiety, depression, disgust, fear, guilt, jealousy, nervousness, pain, sadness, shame, neutral

\* denotes the new topics added during the second collection. We hope new data supports the future research in transferring the ability of models from old topics to new ones.

## Preparing Enviroment

```bash
conda env create -f env.yml -n cuda
conda activate cuda
```

## Downloading Model

You should first download the [BlenderBot-small](https://huggingface.co/facebook/blenderbot_small-90M) model and replace the fake `pytorch_model.bin` file in `Blenderbot_small-90M` with the true one.

If you would like to evaluate generated results with Embedding-based similarity, you can download my prepared embedding files from [here](https://1drv.ms/f/s!Aky8v8NZbQx1qj7OlJKcQEJ6qrWm).

## Preprocessing Training Data

Run `bash RUN/prepare_strat_emotion.sh` to preprocess the training data.

## Training Your Model

Run `bash RUN/train_strat_emotion.sh` to train your model.

## Inference with Your Model

Every time of model training will create a new folder in `DATA/{inputter_name}.{config_name}`, which is named after the time when the training starts. You should select a checkpoint (it may be based on the PPL of validation), and replace the checkpoint path in `RUN/infer_strat_emotion.sh --load_checkpoint` with the path of your selected checkpoint.

Then, run `bash RUN/infer_strat_emotion.sh` to do the inference.

**Note**: When you run `infer_strat_emotion.sh`, you can change `GOLDEN_TRUTH` in  `inputters/PARAMS.py` to control whether use the golden strategy during inference.

## Interacting with Your Model

Similar to inference, after designating the checkpoint in `RUN/interact_strat_emotion.sh- -load_checkpoint`, run `bash RUN/interact_strat_emotion.sh`.
