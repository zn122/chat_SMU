Do you think there was a specific instance that is causing doubts within yourself or is it in your nature to self-doubt? \n","neutral\n","3.4968432784080505\n","It is in my nature to self doubt. Additionally, I have had a few bumps in the road during my program and struggle to pick myself up after those bumps. For example, I am on academic probation and have a certain expectation over the next few months that I have to hit to stay in the program due to struggles in previous classes. I am reaching the bar just fine, according to those that I work with, and often feel I am doing quite well but occasionally I start to panic and think that I am not doing as well as I think that I am and start to spiral \n","anxiety\n","3.473857343196869\n","This has also been a past struggle of mine, and I think it partially stems from the bar we set so high for ourselves. We obviously cannot reach the top right away, but have to work our way up. Often times, when facing an obstacle, such as a bad grade, we might retreat further down the path due to fear that it will keep happening. I know that I personally had a tendency to think of my family and friends who I feel are dependent on me or comparing myself with others when the only person we should think of in these instances is ourself. When making progress, tiny steps upward matter more than you think. But when we take a step backward, we cannot fall back down to the starting point by letting our doubts pile upon one another. \n","neutral\n","2.8731292486190796\n","That is a really good point and helpful. Thank you! \n","neutral\n","0.9448087215423584\n","Of course, I am happy to help! I have noticed that letting yourself celebrate a good grade can be really helpful to feel that you are enough and making good progress. But when things do go south, because life certainly happens, we must stay in the present and live life like we usually would, with a drive that we are going to push harder against whatever we have to face next. \n","neutral\n","1.536240130662918\n","That is exactly right. I need to focus more on what progress has been made and not on what progress hasn't been made yet because there is still time to make that progress. \n","neutral\n","1.5448935329914093\n","Exactly! I also suggest if you are having doubts, talk it out with someone like your partner or a close friend. They can often provide a pick me up you didn't even know you needed. More than anything, give yourself credit and relax. Take some time to just breathe and release the tension. I guarantee it will leave you feeling refreshed and fulfilled for the next tasks you have to face. I believe you can do this and I feel that you believe it too, which is amazing. As often as it is said, believing in yourself is truly the best foundation to achieve your goals. \n","neutral\n","1.3377457857131958\n","Thanks for the advice and believing in me.

All we can do sometimes is pick ourselves back up and keep plugging along.  There are a few apps available that have calming music, stories to listen to,  or even breath exercises to try.

I think you are right in that the ambiguity of social interaction online makes him more inclined to say extreme thinks, perhaps to get a reaction.
